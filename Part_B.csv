Our story started in the hotel and travel sphere some time ago, and as you can see, we never left. Just like we did not leave Amsterdam. Loving to share and being passionate hosts, it has been our pleasure to welcome guests to our Amsterdam BnB for more than 2 decades. Always taking care of our guest's experience and needs together, we would love to welcome you to Amsterdam as well. A personal and warm welcome is always provided, but besides that, you will not notice us, though you can always reach us – we live on the premises with our two cats Rosie and Billy, in the mornings often joined by a Grey Heron, who we love to feed. We feel that doing good is important, we are committed to good causes and are active in different charity projects.

She is build in 2001 and has been used mostly for romantic sailing trips and weddings. <br /><br />Nowadays she has been refitted to accommodate groups of passengers (up to 12 people). The traditional white sailing barge in combination with a more modern and luxury interior gives the whole ship an interesting twist and a perfect place to unwind and relax.","The ship is moored in the marina of IJburg. Characteristic of IJburg is that it's located on an archipelago of artificial islands in the IJmeer. As a result, the ship is right next to (or should we say in) the IJmeer, and makes you simply a few minutes away from beautiful nature reserves. The swamp forest 'Diemer Vijfhoek' is a well-known one, where the alternation of wetlands, open water and reed lands make it a true bird paradise. You can walk here from the boat in 20 minutes.<br /><br />Fort Island Pampus is a stone's throw from the venue. The ferry service to Pampus departed just around the corner. <br /><br />Craving an adventure a bit more far away? Polder IJdoorn and Vuurtoreneiland are located slightly to the north of the location and can be reached via Zeeburg. Here you can walk beautifully and enjoy the unique flora & fauna.<br /><br />Still looking for the crowds? Amsterdam is less than 20 minutes away.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/hosting/Hosting-U3RheVN1cHBseUxpc3Rpbmc6NzQ3NTUxODA2MDIxNjA3Mjkw/original/3d27e61b-3638-41fa-a9fe-4c557fb40a85.jpeg,416591942,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/416591942,Tim,2021-08-03,,,,,,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/cfe02ec4-d91d-4514-ad01-162e27c2ca0b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/cfe02ec4-d91d-4514-ad01-162e27c2ca0b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,2.0,2.0,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",IJburg - Zeeburgereiland,,52.353468803428335,5.005459607409666,Boat,Entire home/apt,12,1.5,1.5 baths,1.0,6.0,"[""Paid street parking off premises"", ""Essentials"", ""Waterfront"", ""EV charger"", ""Private entrance"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Stove"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Boat slip"", ""First aid kit"", ""Hot water"", ""Kitchen"", ""Bed linens"", ""Microwave"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Central heating"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Lake access"", ""Body soap"", ""Oven"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Shared beach access"", ""Coffee"", ""Host greets you"", ""Dining table"", ""Hot water kettle""]",$530.00,2,30,2,2,30,30,2.0,30.0,,t,19,46,68,340,2025-06-17,56,26,2,174,22,203,107590.0,2023-03-12,2025-06-01,4.98,4.96,4.8,4.89,4.93,4.77,4.71,Exempt,t,1,1,0,0,2.03

Spread over 2 floors, it comfortably accommodates 4 people with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. On the garden side there is a large sliding door to a large garden with picnic table and fixed barbecue. On the waterfront there is another sliding door to a floor where to enjoy a breakfast in the sun and on the water. Perfectly located in a park and a quiet neighborhood and close to local attractions.","The houseboat is located together with 10 other boats hidden in a car-free green strip on Willem de Zwijgerlaan. On the waterfront you have a view of the oldest distribution center in Amsterdam. Here, all fresh products for restaurants and shops in Amsterdam are sold. A real eye-catcher is the huge mural of Keith Haring on the side of the former cold house on the property. The work of 12 by 15 meters is Haring's second largest existing mural in public space in Europe. From the houseboat you also have a view of this mural.<br /><br />Within a radius of 500 m there are a number of supermarkets and an evening shop that is open daily until 1 o'clock at night. There are also plenty of restaurants and cafes where you can eat and/or drink.<br /><br />At 10 minutes walk you have the Ten Katemarkt (day market) with adjacent De Hallen. <br /><br />The famous Jordaan(neighborhood) with every Saturday the Noordermarkt is 20 minutes walk from the houseboat.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-867101478989168185/original/d75f6589-b77e-4d47-8a89-9f9f0f24f03a.jpeg,509523715,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/509523715,Frank,2023-04-11,"Amsterdam, Netherlands","Hoi hallo,
