My boyfriend (Thomas) and I bought this totally renovated apartment 10 years ago. We love our house because of its central location and the nice view over the water of the Da Costakade. It feels like a private lake just in front of our door. When the sun comes out our garden-side balcony is the perfect place for a morning breakfast and coffee. And in the afternoon we often enjoy a glass of wine on our French balcony on the other side of the apartment, watching many boats come by on the canal. 
Last summer we discovered the Amsterdam canals with our own private boat. Being near the water or on the water is one of the most relaxing things you can do in this city (there’s a boat rental nearby if you would like to try).  We also enjoy cooking and dining at home or somewhere else in the city. If you are interested I can give you some nice tips for sightseeing, shopping, the best coffee place, bakery and dining places in the neighbourhood.

In my humble opinion I am very privileged to live in one of the most special places in the world: Durgerdam (Amsterdam - North).  On a historical dyke (former fisherman village), next to the IJsselmeer lake, in the typical Dutch rural landscape, but still very close to the unique city of Amsterdam.

As television producer I did (and do)  travel  a lot and I am always a fan of remarkable, unique accommodations to sleep and to stay in. Especially  excited do I get  when they are placed in the middle of nature or at unique locations.  Inspired by my visits to those spots, I decided to build my own little house, with all the comfort you need on a special place; my hometown Durgerdam/Amsterdam North.

Together with an architect we created the Tiny House. An authentic small wouden house, where I hope a lot of other people feel at home and can enjoy the green area & of course Amsterdam..
