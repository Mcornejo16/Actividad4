The area is named after the Spaarndammerdijk and – street, which accumulates the northern and eastern boundary.<br /><br />The construction of the Spaarndammerbuurt started at the end of the 19th century. The streets have been named after places situated in the West and northwest of Amsterdam. The labor houses had especially been intended for the dock workers, who worked in the ports nearby.<br /><br />The most famous buildings in the Spaarndammerbuurt are designed by Michel de Klerk, who devised labor apartments in the style of the Amsterdam School, situated at the Spaarndammerplantsoen. In the years around 1920, three of his housing blocks got constructed.<br /><br />The most striking design is 'The Ship’, located along the Zaanstraat. The houses were 'palaces for the workers’, because before no one really cared about the design of the worker’s houses.<br /><br />Also a post office was part of the block-system.
