It took a year before everything was renovated, but now we have our dreamhouse! 
We love to travel so we are away a lot from home and want to let others enjoy our home. 

We like to watch good movies & series so we have a big 3D 55inch flatscreen  with netflix on it and a very comfi couch with loveseat to enjoy this screentime and makes it almost better as watching it in the cinema!

I have a big passion for cooking and as you see we have a open kitchen where there is everything you need, one big oven and a small oven, 6 pitt gaspit and a cookisland to prepare your 3 course menu or to bake pies & cupcakes what Suzanne likes to do. When the weather is good we can go up to the rooftopterrace and chill on the loungeset and make some burgers on the BBQ and enjoy the endless sun and nice view over Amsterdam.

We are both big music lovers and I also play the drums and have an electronic drum in the livingroom, feel free to play some tunes but keep the headset on for the neighbours.

We are very easy going people who like festivals, concerts, movie & theater a lot. Our house is in the weekends filled with friends and/or family to have nice dinners and chilltime. Our neighbourhood is very beautifull and quiet, around the corner there is the smallest canal of Amsterdam, a beautifull old mill and also a big playground for children next to the water. The street next behind ours you'll find a small shoppingstreet with big supermarket, several (take-away) restaurants, lunch & coffeeplaces, 2 drugstores, officesupplie store, flowershop and nightshops. 
We live close to hotspots where the Amsterdam-people go to such as The Marktkantine, The Foodhallen and Westerpark. We go there a lot because all three full of good food & drinks, music, party even movies and other cultural events!
We live very happy & peacefull in our house, if you rent it you will feel the good energy and the big amount of sunshine through the whole house. We do expect that if you stay here you take good care of our home while were not there. So if you want to party do it outside of the house, you're in Amsterdam enough pleaces to go to! 

We will leave a small guide, where you find everything in our neighbourhood and the public transport. We hope you will enjoy our house and Amsterdam to the fullest!

first line of a poem by Roman Emperor Hadrian 138 AC
Meaning Little soul, little wanderer, little charmer.

Once a traveler, always a traveler. If it isn't outbound, it's inward. And it isn't about the destination. It's about the road.  Going up and down, left and right. Sometimes welcoming with lots of comfortable hide aways. Challenging at all times. 

I prefer the word Tao. Literary meaning way, path or route. Because it clarifies the point of traveling which is to cross borders, going beyond the clearly visible, the well sign posted and known world and even beyond the world of physical appearances all together. 

Many years ago I set out traveling to expand my geographical map. I end up expanding my mind map. 

I like to share with you the place I call home. As a resting place for you on your travels through life. 

I manage to earn a living as a yoga teacher with some side hustles. I run a little webshop and I work as a chef or a hostess in the catering business. I love my partner who lives oversees like he’s Romeo and I am Juliette. I love my two beautiful daughters.

I've lived in Rotterdam, London and now in Amsterdam and work in the media industry. I love sports, cycling (you'll find some references in the house), snowboarding, rockclimbing and lots more. Big travelling fan. Have always gone lots to Asia and Latin America, but have more recently been focused more on the delights on culturally splendid Europe.

I also love going out and enjoying the very best Amsterdam has to offer. So absolutely very happy to help you find a cool restaurant, hip bar, or other hidden gem.
